# 2019 Fall Problems for Purdue ECE 264 "Advanced C Programming"

This class is going through major restructuring to reflect the needs
of students, new technologies in software engineering, and
expectations from industry.

The problems are classified into four parts:

* Part 1: Each focuses on a narrowly defined problem.

* Part 2: Each requires integration of the knowledge and skills for solving several related problems.

* Part 3: Advanced materails that may not be completely covered in this class.

* Part 4: Experiment create a large program by students across multiple semesters
